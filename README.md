- This addons purpose is to automatically turn off autoplay as soon as the video starts.
- When addon is active, clicking on the "Autoplay" button in the YouTube player will turn on autoplay. This will play the next video but won't turn on autoplay globally (It will be turned off when the next video starts). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44535341/168480017-73f14c7d-28bb-44c1-b7da-bf27baf0a4c6.png)

- Clicking on the button in the popup window will activate/deactivate the addon. When the addon is turned on, its functionality is active, and "Autoplay" on all videos will be turned off (on video start). If the addon is deactivated, it will not affect the functionality of YouTube "Autoplay". When activating/deactivating the addon, all YouTube pages will automatically reload to apply changes. *Deactivating addon does not change button state.
